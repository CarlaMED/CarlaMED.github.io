							<h2>Other Projects</h2>
							<p>Below are the other modules/ projects from this year.</p>
							<div class="features">

									<h3>Programming and Mathematics -C#</h3>
									<p> For this project, the class was tasked with creating a star map simulation in Unity (game engine). This included creating a random spawning script for the stars and then implementing a pathfinding algorithm (I chose Dijkstra). Additional features included are UI, a button so that the use can choose either fuel or distance.</p>

									<h3>Data Analytics -Python</h3>
									<p>Descriptive analytics was used to describe the data by summarizing its main characteristics. This included finding the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the data. Hypotheses were defined and tested for the dataset. This involved using statistical tests to determine if there was a significant relationship between two or more variables. Classification techniques were used to classify data points into one of two or more categories. Association rules techniques were used to find relationships between two or more variables. For each technique chosen for the prediction models, an analysis of its effectiveness in relation to this dataset was provided.</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Algorithms and Data Structures -Python</h3>
									<p>The requirements for this assessment were to design a piece of software using:
										at least one of the data structures (queues/piles/graphs/trees)
										proposed in lectures, at least one of the sorting algorithms studied during the lectures, at least one of the searching algorithms studied during the lectures and software tests and analysis of algorithm complexity (temporal complexity using Big-O Notation)
										.</p>
								</section>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Artificial Intelligence -Python</h3>
									<p>For this assignment we had to sucessfully implement a CNN, an RNN and an optimsation algorithm to help a social media market place for the particular troubles they were facing.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Artificial Intelligence Ethics </h3>
									<p>For this assignment we analyse a dataset and consider the AI biases that could be in place and how they can be resolved and prevented.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Professional Awareness -C#</h3>
									<p>For this project I am a part of a multidisaplinary group, where we use a simulation that we created on unity of a drone. My role was to create a to scale model of the drone in simulation form and assisting with the pathfinding algorithm. The project is to essentially use machine and transfer learning and implement it into our real life drone.</p>
